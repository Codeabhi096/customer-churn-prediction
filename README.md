## 📌 Overview

**Customer churn prediction** helps businesses forecast which customers are likely to stop using their services or products. By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention, offer personalized incentives, and enhance customer satisfaction.

In this project, we:
- Built a machine learning model to predict churn probability
- Identified key churn factor
- Used various visualization techniques to analyze user behavior

## 🤔 Why Predict Customer Churn?

Retaining a customer is often cheaper than acquiring a new one. For subscription-based or repeat-client businesses (like ISPs or e-commerce), churn means loss of potential future revenue.

Example:
> A telecom or internet provider invests in technicians and hardware to onboard a customer. If that customer churns after a month, it becomes a financial loss. Therefore, **early churn detection = saved revenue.**

## 📊 Case Study: E-Commerce Churn

An e-commerce company wants to launch targeted marketing campaigns. To do so, they use historical user data (logins, payments, satisfaction score, etc.) to:
- Predict churn probability
- Discover usage patterns
- Retain high-risk users using personalized strategies

We could use Hyperparamete Tuning or Feature enginnering methods to improve the accuracy further.
